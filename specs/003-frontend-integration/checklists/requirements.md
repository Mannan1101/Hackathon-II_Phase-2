## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items complete

**Summary**:
- 4 user stories with clear priorities (P1-P4)

- User stories are independently testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not implementation details
- Technical Context section provides helpful context but doesn't leak into requirements
